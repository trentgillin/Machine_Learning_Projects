## Overview

This is a fun project where I plan to store any kind of fun data science projects. I really just
want to use the data sets to enhance my machine learning and visualization skills. This will always be a work in progress with new data and code being constantly added. 

## Table Of Contents

- Coffee: data pulled from [jldbc-github](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database). This 
is web scraped data from the Coffee Quality Institute's webpage. The data consists of different coffee bean reviews. In this project, I will build a model that is able to predict a coffee bean's quality.
